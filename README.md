### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. The DOM Tree: each node of this tree represents a part of the document. This includes the head and body, and the subsequent nodes that are placed underneath them. Element, attribute, and text nodes are the most common nodes used in this structure.
2. getElementById: this method is used to return an id value that was created in HTML. It returns to the user the first element in the document that has a matching id attribute.
3. getElementsByTagName: this method is like getElementById, but it instead returns an array of elements that match a specific tag name.
